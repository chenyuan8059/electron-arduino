### Electron-Arduino

An Electron app and an Arduino library that exchange data with each other via serial.

Nice tools for developing a PID controller.

# Features

1. 8 params and 2 graphs are provided.
2. Simple APIs like `sendGraphData`, `readParams` in the Arduino library.
3. Adaptive layout is used in the Electron app. Free window size.
4. An additional PID controller library for Arduino.
